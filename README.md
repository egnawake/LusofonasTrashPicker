## Introdução

The objective of this project is to identify and understand the positives and negatives of specifically using Naive Bayes Classifier. It is expected that the Ai will perform in an adequate matter sense it will use human gameplay for it's learning data.
The game itself will be a simple trash colecting game, where the player can always choose between moving on the board, trying to pick up trash or doing something randomly. The game ends when the number of turns reaches 0 at which point the game will tell you how much you scored.
The article we chose is [Mimicking human strategies in fighting games using a Data Driven Finite State Machine](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6030356) where the goal was to achieve human like strategies using both NBC and FSM in a fighting game. What this project will attempt to is to show the strengths of just using NBC alongside a FSM.
